**📂 Unit 1 Assignment: Foundations & Algorithmic Analysis**
The following tasks were implemented independently to demonstrate foundational DS concepts:

Recursive Factorial & Fibonacci: Implementations of both naive and memoized versions to compare efficiency.
Performance Analysis: Detailed time and space complexity justifications, specifically addressing why naive Fibonacci is inefficient ($O(2^n)$).
Tower of Hanoi: Recursive solution including a manual state trace for 
N
=
3
 and derivation of time complexity.
Recursive Binary Search: Implementation with a complexity explanation based on the recurrence intuition T(n)=T(n/2)+O(1).
